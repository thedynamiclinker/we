Welcome to We.

What is We?

    Don't you mean "What are We"? ...(

            Sorry.

Ok, where were we?

Ah, right.

Let's start over.

Welcome to We.

What is We?

We is a modest project in the field of religion, written by a band of non-believers, that aims to bring religion to the approximately 1 billion humans in the world who do not believe, as we do.

We does this...

```
...(
    
    We do* this? ...(
        
        Stop it! ...(
            
            Sorry, last time I promise.
            
        )
    )
)
```

...without requiring the reader to believe one single thing we say.

If you do not believe, as we (think) we (probably) don't,

We will bring an obsession with the bible into your life,

an obsession that will never leave you, for as long as you love.

We does not ask the reader to have a religious experience,

We does not ask you to turn you "soul" (whatever that is) to Some Guy in the Sky,™

We does not ask you to believe in a soul or Sky Guy™ at all.

We takes the bible neither literally nor figuratively.

We believes the only thing more tiresome than trying to take the bible literally is the exhausting act of claiming that it is "metaphor" or "symbolism," and then claiming with a straight face that it's well written.

On the surface, it's simply not.

On the surface, the bible is a horribly written and wildly overrated book, and we spent our youths (and our adulthoods too (still now)) being quite baffled as to why so many people think it's "good."

In terms of fiction, the bible can't compete with Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter, either in terms of quality of writing or the ability to tell a story that keeps the average human entertained.

In terms of non-fiction, the bible can't compete with a good book on Quantum Mechanics or Relativity, either in terms of truth of its content, or of the sheer mind-boggling content about actual reality that it contains.

Nevertheless, if you continue long enough with We, you will spend the rest of your life returning in moments of heated obsession to various bibles, biblical archaeology, and your curiosity and thirst for knowledge about this field will never leave you, as long as you live.

We Guarantees It.™
