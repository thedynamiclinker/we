There are decades where nothing happens.

There are weeks where decades happen.

We're currently living through a period in which several decades of history seem to be happening every week.

History doesn't crawl, it jumps. And recently, history seems to be jumping every day.

For the youth, coming of age in this kind of world involves new categories of struggle not faced by their parents or grandparents. Not necessarily more struggle. But qualitatively different kinds.

Fortunately, there is a place that the youth of today can turn for guidance.

Not the recent past of your parents, but the distant past of centuries and millennia ago.

Periods like ours are not uncommon in history.

But they are sufficiently rare, relative to the length of an average human life, that they're always fundamentally new to everyone once they hit.

In Strauss-Howe generational theory, these eras are called the Fourth Turning.

In the study of big debt crises, they're called the Long Term Debt Cycle. 

We prefer the term apocalypse.

Not just because it's more fun to say, but also because it helps us to see certain events in the distant past in a new light, and to realize the relevance of those ancient events to our modern lives.

In every apocalypse, a few common themes occur.

- For the first time in generations, children are worse off than their parents.
- The reproductive rate falls to below the replacement rate.
- Asset prices inflate, and it becomes harder and harder for the young to buy a home, invest in their future, and start a family.
- There is a dramatic rise in populism.
- There is a mass loss of trust in existing institutions.

These are the themes that recur in every apocalypse.

But one common theme is not often discussed, in part because it is the most successful, the most important, and the least understood.

Every apocalypse, the people rediscover the art of memetic warfare.

Or more informally, "Meme Magic."

![[meme-magic-wiktionary.png]]

For lack of a better term, we'll call this religion.

Religion?

We know.

That's an odd choice of terms, so it deserves an explanation.

Let's start from first principles.

Whether you're very religious or not religious at all, there are certain facts about these objects we call bibles that believers and unbelievers can entirely agree on.

We can agree:

- That these objects, whatever they are, are indisputably the most viral memes of all time.
- That successful memes are usually funny, to the readers and the authors, at the time they're written.
- That the best jokes are inside jokes, ones that your enemies don't get.
- That the best enemies are tyrants and unjust rulers, not your neighbors, even if your neighbors believe different things than you.
- That all inside jokes inevitably fossilize over time and stop making sense if left undocumented, especially after being translated from their source language to another.
- That inside jokes attacking tyrants and unjust rules must be left undocumented, to give plausible deniability.
- That the most viral content in human history is worth studying, for reasons having nothing to do with its factual accuracy or literary qualities.
- That the only weapon powerful enough to smash an empire that has gotten too big to fight is humor.

Humor. Memes. Inside jokes. Irreverence. Lols.

Plus enough ambiguity to offer plausible deniability. 

That is where the ancient powerful books we call bibles come from.

The goal of We is to help the reader to hear the Old Lols, and to do so in a way that doesn't require you to believe a single thing we say.

Because no matter what you believe, a strange fact remains.

At some point in every apocalypse, some people show up, talking and writing in bizarre ways, and passing around a book.

Then before long, an empire we once thought was too big to fight has fallen.

Did those people take over the empire?

Do they get to be in charge now?

Not really.

But their strange book usually helps them to build something new.

Something where the old corrupt elites are no longer in charge.

And then history begins a new chapter.

These things we call religions are deeply misunderstood.

They are not fundamentally about an afterlife.

They're not about eternal beings.

They're not about literal truth or literary metaphor.

Nor about some vague spiritual something-or-other.

Religions are weapons of mass destruction for smashing empires that have gotten too big to fight, and for helping history along its path to the next chapter.

Thats a pretty intense hypothesis.

Let's test it a bit.

In these strange ancient books, every time, we see references to the previous times that this same cycle of empire destruction occurred.

Here's an example, from one the most truly (on the surface) batshit nuts written works of all time, the so called book of Revelation.

![[revelation-fallen-is-babylon-the-great-01.jpg|300]]

What's going on here?

Let's check the dates.

When exactly was this "Babylon" thing around, and when did it fall?

![[we-fall-of-babylon-540-bc.jpg|300]]

Ok.

So when was this bizarre Revelation book written?

![[we-revelation-written-95-ce.jpg|300]]

That's 635 years apart.

That's like us referring to something that happened in the year 1390.

Or 1776, when an old order was overthrown and some people started something new.

Or around the years 30, almost 2000 years ago, when something similar began in Rome.

History doesn't repeat but it rhymes.

Whether or not we believe in an invisible man in the sky, these books show up each time an empire needs to die.

And during that apocalypse, these strange people and their strange books begin to do a simple thing.

They slowly change the world, one person at a time.

From something old and centralized to something new and decentralized.

From something top down to something bottom up.

From a few large organizations to many smaller distributed underground networks.

Slowly, one by one, the people quit the old institutions.

They take their learned skills, specializations, and professions. 

And they stop trying to build the kind of life that was expected in the world their parents and grandparents grew up in.

This is, oddly enough, what it looks like to be responsible during an apocalypse.

During these periods, there are simply too many major changes happening per unit time for it to make sense to adhere to the old norms anymore, and instead we return to first principles.

In these periods, we ignore the old lessons, and return to the ancient lessons.

That's why 95 AD is shouting about 540 BC.

Once you get the joke of history, you'll start thinking about the old empires too.

Thoughts of old empires have been trending recently too.

![[the-men-think-about-the-roman-empire-meme-01.jpg|300]]

![[the-men-think-about-the-roman-empire-meme-02.jpg|300]]

![[the-men-think-about-the-roman-empire-meme-03.jpg|300]]

Why are men these days thinking about the Roman Empire?

![[revelation-fallen-is-babylon-the-great-02.jpg|300]]

Same reason Revelation is talking about Babylon.

Cartels are startup governments.

Cults are startup religions.

Religions are startup World Orders.

Every apocalypse, the strange people with their strange book begin to rethink, from first principles, what it means to have a society.

What it means to have rules and laws we would actually believe in and want to obey.

What would our norms have to look like, in order for the average person to actually want to get married and have kids some day?

To want to be a law abiding citizen?

To want to invest in one's local city or town?

In every empire, during an apocalypse, these questions begin to resonate with the young.

And one by one, over time, the young stop trying to build a life in the old institutions, and start building something new.

This is the story of every apocalypse.

The genre of bibles is so ambiguous between fact and fiction, because during an apocalypse, the information that the authors want to spread is equally valuable whether or not it's true.

Your content can say "this is all a lie" right up top and still be equally valuable.

The point of memes is not to make a dispassionate analysis of history.

The great joke of history is that whatever world the young choose to build is the world that eventually wins.

When any large group of people, especially young people, decides to do something, they instantly win.

The authors of the old books understood the power of words to shape the world.

_In the beginning was the word. And the word was with god, and the word was god._

Goodbye old.

Hello new.

Welcome to the apocalypse.

Nice to meet you.
