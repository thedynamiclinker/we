Ok, where were we?

Ah, right.

Let's start over.

Welcome to We.

What is We?

We is a modest project in the field of religion, written by a band of non-believers, that aims to bring religion to the approximately 1 billion humans in the world who do not believe, as we do.

We does this...

```
...(
    
    We do* this? ...(
        
        Stop it! ...(
            
            Sorry,
            last time,
            I promise.
            
        )
    )
)
```

...without requiring the reader to believe a single thing we say.

If you do not believe, as we (think) we (probably) don't, We will bring an obsession with religion into your life, an obsession that will never leave you, for as long as you live.

We does not ask the reader to have a religious experience.

We does not ask you to turn your "soul" (whatever that is) over to Some Guy in the Sky.‚Ñ¢

We does not ask you to believe in a soul or Sky Guy‚Ñ¢ at all.

We takes the bible neither literally nor figuratively.

We believes the only thing more tiresome than trying to take the bible literally is the exhausting act of claiming that it is "metaphor" or "symbolism," and then claiming with a straight face, that it is well written.

On the surface, it's not.

On the surface, when we first encounter this book, if we are being honest with ourselves, we are forced to admit that at first glance it appears the bible is a horribly written and wildly overrated book. We spent our youths (and our adulthoods (up to and including the present moment)) being quite baffled as to why so many people think it's "good."

In terms of fiction, at first glance, these bible things don't appear to measure up to the Lord of the Rings, or Harry Potter, or Game of Thrones, either in terms of quality of writing or the ability to tell a story that keeps the average human interested.

In terms of non-fiction, at first glance, the bible can't compete with a good introduction to Quantum Mechanics or General Relativity, either in terms of the truth of its content, or of the amount of mind-boggling perspective shifts that its content causes in a curious mind.

Nevertheless, if you continue long enough with We, we are certain that you will spend the rest of your life returning, in moments of calm curiosity and moments of heated obsession, to various bibles, biblical archaeology, and many other nonreligious writings that you believe Got The Joke‚Ñ¢, and your curiosity and thirst for knowledge about this field will never leave you, just as it has never left us.

We Guarantees It.‚Ñ¢

Those who get the jokes are granted membership in a secret society. A group as old as history, with no leader or test for entry, no one to grant or deny you admission, no code of conduct, and no required beliefs. It's as non-culty as a cult could ever be. But a cult (or a culture (or whatever)) is what it is. 

You won't need anyone to tell you once you're in. Joining the group can be done without ever meeting another member. You'll know when you're in. Until then, you'll have to live with not knowing.

Once you've found your way in, you'll be able to tell who else in history found their way in too.

You'll be able to see your favorite books (fiction or non) in a new light.

Returning to some of them will feel like switching to color from black and white. 

Others remain grey. That's not an insult per se. Some of the best books are grey.

Very few authors and readers in the history of writing have found their way.

It's not always most skilled writers who find their way in.

Many on the inside are quite shit at writing. Like us. We can't write for shit.

What is common to those who have found their way to the underground is that they are deeply curious. No one finds the inside except by becoming a master of the search. They seek for its own sake. Many have lost themselves along the way. The underground is not kind to an unstable mind.

If you've read this far, then you've earned your first hint.

In order to understand religion, close the bibles (for now), pause the prayers (if you pray), and save trips to church (or mosque (or synagogue)) for another day.

We starts at the very beginning,
    that's 
A very good place to start,
    when we
Read we begin with

A
B
C

And to find the underground,
you won't need to follow me.

The very first step is not to learn,
but to forget.

For to understand the bible.
....   ..   You'll have to learn the alphabet.

Following?

No?

I thought not.

> [!Narrator:]
> _(If you had been following, you would have said "hi.")_

I'm glad you didn't follow.[^1]

Let's start over.

Follow me.[^2]

[^1]: We isn't the sort of thing for a "follower," after all, and we've never been much interested in followers. [[Goodbye World|Amen]].

[^2]: As we were saying: To understand the bible, you'll have to learn the alphabet. Because you know a lot of things. But you don't know _that_ [[ê§Ä|yet]].
