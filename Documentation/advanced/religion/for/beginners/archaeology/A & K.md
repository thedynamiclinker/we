    What is age?

    Not in physics or law or social affairs
    but in each of us.
    Across time.
    In the mind.

    What happens to us throughout our lives? 

    Our philosophies ask countless questions
    that sound deceptively similar to this one
    without ever approaching the thought processes
    required to address the question quite right.

    To see the truth(,s) of the matter(,s) we
    need a broader vantage than our co(mmon + nventions)
    of propriety & the parochial boundaries of
    (,our) culture(,s) permit because as we al(l,ready)
    know from all the old cliches
    it never has been age per se
    that makes us rot.

	But we do
    a fucking lot &
    more often than not we don't expect it to
	come how │ why │ when it does
	But it does...
	
	We age in the moments we least expect to..
	       in our moments of stasis
	& safety
	& sanity
	& success
	& these experiences (by 
	& large) are decoupled from time th{,r}ough time's
	linearity an unavoidable correlation between age \
	& these experiences arises \
	& the result is that over a lifetime
	We may age like wine or meat \
	|| like milk || bread | cheese 
	&& the manners of rot | lack thereof
	take 二 many forms 二 enumerate

    ㅎ 一 二

	here 一 but as we all know 一 though
	a thing may be all around us,
	screaming out of every corner
	and crevice in the
	loudest possible voice,
	
	our brains, 4 some reason, of\
	十+ten fail to

	) & one day, in a letter dated January 25,
	K wrote something in some language that meant
	something like this:

> _It is a bad thing to perform menial duties even for the sake of freedom; to fight with pinpricks, instead of with clubs. I have become tired of hypocrisy, stupidity, gross arbitrariness, and of our bowing and scraping, dodging, and hair-splitting over words. Consequently, the government has given me back my freedom._
> - K, Circa nearabouts 1 month & 1 day after the first day of K's first (over-9000)th day.

	(Or equivalently, K's life on day 9032.)


See, what happened was that K had been working

at something called a newspaper,

where (if my memory serves)

K was something called the editor,

but despite that, K kind of hated doing the job,

because it didn't give K any sense of like, "meaning,"

so even though it meant losing the job at the newspaper,

K was kinda happy when the whole job got "dissolved"

by something called the government

of something called Prussia.

... Following?

K.

	(That was K on day 9032..)
                           ..

    But let's not forget   ..

                       二  二
	A.k.a., A.

	Now we don't have anything that happen{s,ed}
	to be dated from day-number-9032 of A's days,
	b/c A took a little bit longer to start (
	    writing, that is (
	        in A's timeline, that is (
	            though technically, overall,
	            A started before K (
	                fuck this, whatever...
	                time is the worst
	            )
            )
        )
	) but once A finally started,
	  he wrote a book-thing,
	  and A decided to write this
	  in Chapter 1:


> _In ease of body and peace of mind, all the different ranks of life are nearly upon a level, and the beggar, who suns himself by the side of the highway, possesses that security which kings are fighting for._
> -A.


    So once A started writing
    and publishing stuff ...(
        and then once a bit of time passed
        and people started to see it
    ) it (
        a.k.a. A's stuff
    ) it pretty quickly turned out
    to be so damn exciting/inspiring\
    /[something-like-that] that lots
    of different student people
    in all sorts of countries said
    "Okay fuck school" ...(
        or something like that
    ) "This place is the worst.
    But this book-thing is great.
    Enough is enough.
    Life is short.
    I'm gonna go hang out with A,"
    and then they left their old schools
    in the countries they were sitting in
    & instead of sitting there they went
    somewhere else, to a different country,
    so they could explore a new place
    and try life again, and maybe while
    they were there they could
    learn stuff from A.

    Cuz they really liked A.

    That's sort of why they went.

    So for awhile after that (
        the two "that"s that is (
            in the aforementioned "then"s
        )
    ) our two heroes (
        together,
        in their different
        (time,) li(n,v)es (
            a.k.a. timelines (
                a.k.a. lives (
                    respectively
                )
            )
        )
        -- a.k.a., K & A
        (or rather A & K
            (if we cared about time)
        )
    ) kept writing and they wrote
      about lots of different stuff,
      and if we stick kinda roughly
      sort-of(-ish) to their (time,)
      li(n,v)es the writings they wrote
      (together (in different times))
      sounded something like this.

> _It is clear that the arm of criticism cannot replace the criticism of arms. Material force can only be overthrown by material force, but theory itself becomes a material force when it has seized the masses. Theory is capable of seizing the masses... as soon as it becomes radical. To be radical is to grasp things by the root. But for man the root is man himself...

> _What a spectacle! A society fragmented by ever-increasing social divisions, each opposed to all the others by petty antipathies, uneasy consciences and brutal mediocrity, and all, precisely because of their mutual ambivalence and suspicion, treated (with minor formal variations) as if their very existence was a privilege that they owed to their rulers. And they are forced to recognize and acknowledge the fact that they are dominated, ruled and owned as a blessing from heaven! Situated above all these sectors are the rulers themselves, whose greatness is in inverse proportion to their number! Criticism dealing with these conditions is a hand-to-hand fight. In such a fight the point is not whether the opponent is a noble or equal or interesting opponent, the point is to hit him. The \[people in K's country\] must not be allowed a single moment for self-deception or resignation. Their oppression must be made even more oppressive by making it known, their shame must be made even more shameful by making it public._

> _Let us consider the actual, worldly Jew -- not the Sabbath Jew, as Bauer does, but the everyday Jew. Let us not look for the secret of the Jew in his religion, but let us look for the secret of his religion in the real Jew. What is the secular basis of Judaism? Practical need, self-interest. What is the worldly religion of the Jew? Huckstering. What is his worldly God? Money. Very well then! Emancipation from huckstering and money, consequently from practical, real Judaism, would be the self-emancipation of our time. An organization of society which would abolish the preconditions for huckstering, and therefore the possibility of huckstering, would make the Jew impossible. His religious consciousness would be dissipated like a thin haze in the real, vital air of society. On the other hand, if the Jew recognizes that this practical nature of his is futile and works to abolish it, he extricates himself from his previous development and works for human emancipation as such and turns against the supreme practical expression of human self-estrangement. We recognize in Judaism, therefore, a general anti-social element of the present time, an element which through historical development -- to which in this harmful respect the Jews have zealously contributed -- has been brought to its present high level, at which it must necessarily begin to disintegrate. In the final analysis, the emancipation of the Jews is the emancipation of mankind from Judaism... The monotheism of the Jew, therefore, is in reality the polytheism of the many needs, a polytheism which makes even the lavatory an object of divine law. Practical need, egoism, is the principle of civil society, and as such appears in pure form as soon as civil society has fully given birth to the political state. The god of practical need and self-interest is money. Money is the jealous god of Israel, in face of which no other god may exist. Money degrades all the gods of man -- and turns them into commodities. Money is the universal self-established value of all things. It has, therefore, robbed the whole world -- both the world of men and nature -- of its specific value. Money is the estranged essence of man’s work and man’s existence, and this alien essence dominates him, and he worships it. The god of the Jews has become secularized and has become the god of the world. The bill of exchange is the real god of the Jew. His god is only an illusory bill of exchange._

What pleases these lovers of toys is not so much the utility, as the aptness of the machines which are fitted to promote it. All their pockets are stuffed with little conveniences. They contrive new pockets, unknown in the clothes of other people, in order to carry a greater number. They walk about loaded with a multitude of baubles, in weight and sometimes in value not inferior to an ordinary Jew's-box, some of which may sometimes be of some little use, but all of which might at all times be very well spared, and of which the whole utility is certainly not worth the fatigue of bearing the burden._

> _Let us suppose that the great empire of China, with all its myriads of inhabitants, was suddenly swallowed up by an earthquake, and let us consider how a man of humanity in Europe, who had no sort of connection with that part of the world, would be affected upon receiving intelligence of this dreadful calamity. He would, I imagine, first of all, express very strongly his sorrow for the misfortune of that unhappy people, he would make many melancholy reflections upon the precariousness of human life, and the vanity of all the labours of man, which could thus be annihilated in a moment. He would too, perhaps, if he was a man of speculation, enter into many reasonings concerning the effects which this disaster might produce upon the commerce of Europe, and the trade and business of the world in general. And when all this fine philosophy was over, when all these humane sentiments had been once fairly expressed, he would pursue his business or his pleasure, take his repose or his diversion, with the same ease and tranquillity, as if no such accident had happened. The most frivolous disaster which could befall himself would occasion a more real disturbance. If he was to lose his little finger to-morrow, he would not sleep to-night; but, provided he never saw them, he will snore with the most profound security over the ruin of a hundred millions of his brethren, and the destruction of that immense multitude seems plainly an object less interesting to him, than this paltry misfortune of his own. To prevent, therefore, this paltry misfortune to himself, would a man of humanity be willing to sacrifice the lives of a hundred millions of his brethren, provided he had never seen them? Human nature startles with horror at the thought, and the world, in its greatest depravity and corruption, never produced such a villain as could be capable of entertaining it. But what makes this difference? When our passive feelings are almost always so sordid and so selfish, how comes it that our active principles should often be so generous and so noble? When we are always so much more deeply affected by whatever concerns ourselves, than by whatever concerns other men; what is it which prompts the generous, upon all occasions, and the mean upon many, to sacrifice their own interests to the greater interests of others? It is not the soft power of humanity, it is not that feeble spark of benevolence which Nature has lighted up in the human heart, that is thus capable of counteracting the strongest impulses of self-love. It is a stronger power, a more forcible motive, which exerts itself upon such occasions. It is reason, principle, conscience, the inhabitant of the breast, the man within, the great judge and arbiter of our conduct._
> -A. (1759).


> _How selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of others, and render their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it, except the pleasure of seeing it._
> -A. (1759).


> _The man of system, on the contrary, is apt to be very wise in his own conceit; and is often so enamoured with the supposed beauty of his own ideal plan of government, that he cannot suffer the smallest deviation from any part of it. He goes on to establish it completely and in all its parts, without any regard either to the great interests, or to the strong prejudices which may oppose it. He seems to imagine that he can arrange the different members of a great society with as much ease as the hand arranges the different pieces upon a chess-board. He does not consider that the pieces upon the chess-board have no other principle of motion besides that which the hand impresses upon them; but that, in the great chess-board of human society, every single piece has a principle of motion of its own, altogether different from that which the legislature might choose to impress upon it. If those two principles coincide and act in the same direction, the game of human society will go on easily and harmoniously, and is very likely to be happy and successful. If they are opposite or different, the game will go on miserably, and the society must be at all times in the highest degree of disorder._
> -A. (1759).


> _No society can surely be flourishing and happy, of which the greater part of the members are poor and miserable. It is but equity, besides, that they who feed, cloath and lodge the whole body of the people, should have such a share of the produce of their own labour as to be themselves tolerably well fed, clothed, and lodged._
> -A. (1776).


> _People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices. It is impossible indeed to prevent such meetings, by any law which either could be executed, or would be consistent with liberty or justice. But though the law cannot hinder people of the same trade from sometimes assembling together, it ought to do nothing to facilitate such assemblies; much less to render them necessary._
> -A. (1776).


> _To widen the market and to narrow the competition, is always the interest of the dealers... The proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which comes from this order, ought always to be listened to with great precaution, and ought never to be adopted till after having been long and carefully examined, not only with the most scrupulous, but with the most suspicious attention. It comes from an order of men, whose interest is never exactly the same with that of the public, who have generally an interest to deceive and even oppress the public, and who accordingly have, upon many occasions, both deceived and oppressed it._
> -A. (1776).


> _The commodities of Europe were almost all new to America, and many of those of America were new to Europe. A new set of exchanges, therefore, began... and which should naturally have proved as advantageous to the new, as it certainly did to the old continent. The savage injustice of the Europeans rendered an event, which ought to have been beneficial to all, ruinous and destructive to several of those unfortunate countries._
> -A. (1776).


> _Upstart greatness is everywhere less respected than ancient greatness._

> _Justice, however, never was in reality administered gratis in any country. Lawyers and attornies, at least, must always be paid by the parties; and, if they were not, they would perform their duty still worse than they actually perform it._
> -A. (1776).


> _The necessaries of life occasion the great expense of the poor. They find it difficult to get food, and the greater part of their little revenue is spent in getting it. The luxuries and vanities of life occasion the principal expense of the rich, and a magnificent house embellishes and sets off to the best advantage all the other luxuries and vanities which they possess. A tax upon house-rents, therefore, would in general fall heaviest upon the rich; and in this sort of inequality there would not, perhaps, be anything very unreasonable. It is not very unreasonable that the rich should contribute to the public expense, not only in proportion to their revenue, but something more than in that proportion._
> -A. (1776).


> _It is unjust that the whole of society should contribute towards an expence of which the benefit is confined to a part of the society._
> -A. (1776).


> _We rarely hear, it has been said, of the combinations of masters, though frequently of those of the workman. But whoever imagines, upon this account, that masters rarely combine, is as ignorant of the world as of the subject._
> -A. (1776).


> _With the greater part of rich people, the chief enjoyment of riches consists in the parade of riches, which in their eye is never so complete as when they appear to possess those decisive marks of opulence which nobody can possess but themselves._
> -A. (1776).


> _Fear is in almost all cases a wretched instrument of government, and ought in particular never to be employed against any order of men who have the smallest pretensions to independency._
> -A. (1776)

    It appears, accordingly,   ┌┴┐
    from the experience of all ages and nations,
    I believe, that the work
    done by freemen comes
    cheaper in the end than
    that performed by slaves.
    -A. (1776).


> _There is no art which one government sooner learns of another than that of draining money from the pockets of the people._
> -A. (1776).


    Every tax, however,
    is to the person who pays it a badge,
    not of slavery but of liberty. It denotes
    that he is a subject to government,
    indeed, but that, as he has some property,
    he cannot himself be the property of a master.
    -A. (1776).


> _The violence and injustice of the rulers of mankind is an ancient evil, for which, I am afraid, the nature of human affairs can scarce admit a remedy._

    At a certain stage of development,
    the material productive forces of
    society come into conflict with the

> _Wherever there is great property, there is great inequality._
> -A. (1776).


    Is that to say we are against Free Trade?
    No, we are for Free Trade, because
    by Free Trade all economical laws,
    with their most astounding contradictions
    will act upon a larger scale,
    upon the territory of the whole earth;
    and because from the uniting of all
    these contradictions in a single group,
    where they will stand face to face,
    will result the struggle which will
    itself eventuate in the emancipation
    of the proletariat.
    -K. (1847).


> _As soon as the land of any country has all become private property, the landlords, like all other men, love to reap where they never sowed, and demand a rent even for its natural produce._
> -A. (1776).


    When [(rich,)Frie(,n)d] and I first joined
    the secret Ko[group]istisch Society
    we made it a condition that everything
    tending to encourage superstitious
    belief in authority was to be
    removed from the statutes.
    -K. (1877).

    All for ourselves, and nothing
    for other people, seems, in every age
    of the world, to have been the    └┬┘
    vile maxim of the masters
    of mankind.
    -A. (1776).

    If anything is certain, it is that
    I myself am not a Marxist.
    -K. (1882).

    The difference between the most dissimilar characters,
    between a philosopher and a common street porter,
    for example, seems to arise not so much from nature,
    as from habit, custom, and education.
       -A. (1776).

What is age?

    The education of the common people requires, perhaps,
    in a civilized and commercial society, the attention
    of the public more than that of people of some rank
    and fortune.
