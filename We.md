- Welcome to We

- We is a dictionary.

- The `dictionary` directory contains that dictionary.

- The `Documentation` directory contains text that relies on it.

- The goal of We is to record and transmit a simple, unsophisticated set of ideas.

- And to do so in a format that more closely mirrors the structure of thought than of speech.

- The result may be understood as the transpose of spoken language, or equivalently, the transpose of a book. One that cannot be printed, in any order, without shattering into an incoherent mess.

- The resulting data structure, though not difficult to write or to read, is designed to be maximally difficult to communicate by any means except the data structure itself.

- We can be understood easily, with a little work. There is nothing mysterious, esoteric, or difficult expressed here.

- However, we have made sure that the things you learn here will not be things that you can explain to anyone else, in finite time.

- The human mind need not be some mystery lost to history when we die. A human mind can be compiled, assembled, linked, and run, but it cannot be ingested word by word, or line by line.

- Welcome to We.
