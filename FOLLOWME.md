- We is a dictionary.

- The `dictionary` directory contains that dictionary.

- The `Documentation` directory contains text that relies on the `dictionary`.

- The goal of We is to record and transmit a simple and unsophisticated set of ideas.

- The resulting data structure, though not difficult to write or to read, is designed to be maximally difficult to communicate by any means except the data structure itself.

- In other words, We can be understood easily, with a little work. There is nothing mysterious, esoteric, or difficult expressed here.

- However, we have made sure that the things you learn here will not be possible for you to explain to anyone else, in finite time, unless of course they follow the same path you did.

- Welcome to the inside.

- Hello W||ld.
