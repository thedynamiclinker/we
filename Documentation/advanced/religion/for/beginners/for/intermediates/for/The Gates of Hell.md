## Redemption of the Devils

Anyone obsessed with redemption of the unredeemed must first by definition become obsessed with the characters we call devils.

The most misunderstood and most abused characters in all of fiction and non-fiction are those who we all agree are the worst entities who've ever existed.

Any redeemer worth h{is,er} salt must naturally first become interested in these characters more than any others.

This is the secret we have to unlock every thousand or two years and then lock back up again tight. Because despite its truth most normal people won't know how to guide their lives if this is what it means to be righteous && right.

So sayeth the L||D.
