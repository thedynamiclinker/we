## What is The Game?

With regard to issues of morality, the public discourse of our species has always been
to position the opinion makers as guards outside the gates of hell, with rejection and
shaming being the only force preventing the infinite diversity of different deplorable
forms of human corruption and sin from breaking through.

In the last several decades, we have not on the whole become more accepting of diversity,
in any significant way.

What we have done is create the illusion of having done so, by opening the gates of hell
for a few scarcely perceptible moments, in order to allow a few new blessed groups in from
the infinite clamoring of forms that live out beyond the gates. We blessed those new groups,
and held them up as idols so vocally and violenty as examples of our virtue that we haven't
noticed all the while our gatekeepers have been barricading the gates more oppressively
than ever before.

The volume with which we trumpet our love of diversity allows us to drown out the invasive
knowledge of a horrible truth we all secretly share -- that no group we have thus far let
in through the gates has proved to be the monsters we'd previously thought. And the more
frightening corrollary, that therefore the gates we've allowed our masters to steadily
fortify are not in fact the shield of protection they claim. They are the exact same
mechanism that once kept out every group we now idolize and protect. The gates of hell
are the way in which we protect ourselves from the real human diversity that is and
always has been the target of our fear.

What monsters still live beyond the gates of our city?

What are they like?

What do they think?

What exactly is it that scares us about them?

What kind of sentient life have we abandoned out there?

We cannot learn by heaping more blame on others.

To learn, each of us must open our own eyes.

The tool by which we open them is known as: the game.
