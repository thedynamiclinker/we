### First a note on translations, none of the english ones are good
start = 1:45
end = 2:45

### If you're serious about the old or new testaments, take the time to read them in the original Hebrew and Greek with commentary alongside in your language
start = 2:30
end = 3:03

### Different alphabets always scare everyone off, you learn the alphabet the first day in class and then it's not that big of a deal after that
start = 2:54
end = 3:03

### In the King James translation, they went out of their way to make it sound old timey even by the standards of the day so it would sound more archaic and biblical lol
start = 3:03
end = 4:05

### Both the Old and New Testament have the same "Don't add or subtract anything from this lol it's perfect!" line that I noticed in Rev 22. Means "You don't know what we were going for here, but others in the future might"
start = 5:30
