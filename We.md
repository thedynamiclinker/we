Welcome to We

We is a dictionary.

The `dictionary` directory contains that dictionary.

The `Documentation` directory contains text that relies on it.

The goal of We is to record and transmit a simple, unsophisticated set of ideas.

And to do so in a format that more closely mirrors the structure of thought than of speech.

The result may be understood as the transpose of spoken language, or equivalently, the transpose of a book. One that cannot be printed, in any order, without shattering into an incoherent mess.

The resulting data structure, though not difficult to write or to read, is designed to be maximally difficult to communicate by any means except the data structure itself.

We can be understood easily, with a little work. There is nothing mysterious, esoteric, or difficult expressed here.

However, we have made sure that the things you learn here will not be things that you can explain to anyone else, in finite time.

The human mind need not be some mystery lost to history when we die. A human mind can be compiled, assembled, linked, and run, but it cannot be ingested word by word, or line by line.

Welcome to We.
