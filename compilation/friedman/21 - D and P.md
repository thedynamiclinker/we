### The priestly source doesn't mention dreams or angels or God appearing to people, the only way to talk to God in the priestly thread is by giving a sacrifice to a priest
start = 0:00
end = 10:00

### Sitcom husbands are disproportionately in advertising, a nod to Eat Mor Chi-kin, and mentioning wanting to make a commercial for the Bible, and you'd have to bring sex into it somewhere

### The change from biblical judaism to rabbinic judaism
start = 13:16
end = 17:14

### The best source of evidence for the threads is linguistic evidence of how the hebrew language changed over time, and the majority of bible scholars refuse to discuss the linguistic evictions

### Wellhausen switched from being a major Old Testament scholar to a major New Testament scholar to a major Quran scholar
start = 29:44

### If the greatest team of Shakespeare fakes could get together and fake a sonnet, you couldn't fool the Shakespeare scholars, it's extremely hard to fool them

### It turns out that Deuteronomy is not a work in its own right, it's part of a collection that includes Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings
start = 36:56
end = 37:25

### Deuteronomy is very strange, it's different from the other four books, it's supposed to be Moses in first person looking back and making a speech, in which he refers to things in the story, but when he refers back to them it's very weird, he never refers to anything in P, he only refers to stuff in J and E

end = 52:54
