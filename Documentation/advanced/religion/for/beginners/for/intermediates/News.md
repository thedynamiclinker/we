PAPER NAME: Iron Dies Quiet.
_(Translated from a Chinese newspaper of the same name.[1])_

ARTICLE NAME: 祁[2] True 鬼.[3] I Sued.

An adult male Chinese person of Chinese descent living in the 
American-Persons-of-Chinese-Descent Town district of Los Angeles (formerly 
known as Chinatown) was found guilty of sexual harassment and racial prejudice
today after he incorrectly stereotyped a Japanese woman as Chinese while trying 
to flirt with her at a bus stop near his home. When asked to excuse his
condemnable behavior as he was being escourted to a local detention facility, 
the racist Qi simply cited "統計!"

According to The Culturally Sensitive Translator's Guide To The Entire Language 
of All Chinese Persons Everywhere, the term "統計" appears to mean "overall 
plan," or "collective reckoning," or "interconnected-system plot," or something 
like that. It is unclear at present what this Qi's "overall plan" in fact was, 
but in any case it sounds suspiciously similar to something the third reich
would have done, and it is clear from his choice of words that he has been
planning this aggressive act for quite some time. Investigation ongoing.

[Translator's Note 1: The meaning of this newspaper's name is unclear. Probably
a metaphor. Most likely something about East Asian philosophy I dunno who even
fucking knows Chinese anyway. (Citation: The Translator, Personal Speculation,
20XY)]

[Translator's Note 2: 祁 (pinyin: Qí). A Chinese surname. Originated from the
descendants of Shaohao, descendant of Yao (ruler), Ji (姬) family of Jin
(Chinese state), Khitan people of Liao Dynasty, Hui people of during the Han
Dynasty, Dongxiang people. (Citation: The Translator, Copy/paste from The
Dynamic Readwriteable Free-Encyclopedic Repository of The Modern State of Human
Knowledge, 20XY.)]

[Translator's Note 3: 鬼 (訓読み: おに; 音読み: キ). A Japanese word
meaning "devil" or "demon." Transliterated into the Latin alphabet as "oni,"
pronounced "oni," singular "oni," plural "oni," b/c for all its orthographic
complications there's at least a certain like almost-mathematical-ish elegance
to both the simple phonetics and the combinatorial agglutinative syntax of the
dirty jap speak ha j(k+p) folks サーセン笑. (Citation: Suspected L.D.™
member, Personal communication in exchange for a bite of my sandwich, 20XY)]

-------------------------------

Editor's Afterword:

In our attempts to write the article above, translating from the original
statements and surrounding court documents, our company was shocked to learn
that we had no actual Chinese people working for us. This came as quite a
surprise, considering the laws mandating equal representation in hiring.
Further investigation into the cause of this situation revealed that what we
have, in fact, done is to hire a set of employees with Chinese parents, though
apparently we somehow managed to avoid hiring any actual Chinese people, or
anyone who is capable of reading Chinese.

"I mean, my parents made me go to Chinese school," one of them was quoted as 
saying, "but it was mostly just a lot of memorization." Another employee said 
she is fluent in Cantonese, but mostly just spoke it at home with her parents, 
never having learned much of the writing system. A third individual was quoted 
as saying "呵呵白人豬蠢笨蛋對牛彈琴,"[1] but he doesn't work here. 
He's somewhere else. No one knows where. We've tried to find him, but thus far 
the search has proved unsuccessful, much like the old Chinese parable of a 
melodious cow searching for his beloved ivory pig, and finding, sadly, only an 
egg. The search for a proper translator continues, as we attempt to determine 
the nature of mister Qi's seditious "collective reckoning" plan.

[Footnote 1: A phrase which appears to translate loosely as "Ha ha. White pig stupid egg to cow playing piano," a beautiful instance of the mysterious metaphorical style of speech that the culture and literature of the Chinese people are so well-known for, and is in no way simply a problem with the translation software.]

In the course of explaining the situation to a colleague over lunch, we were
approached by a teenager of unknown ethic background, most likely hispanic,[2]
wearing a torn, ill-fitting mickey mouse sweatshirt with stains of jam and what 
may have been blood or possibly ketchup,[3] who stated that she had overheard 
our conversation, and claimed to know, and I quote, _"Like a reasonably okay 
amount of like Chinese and Japanese and Korean and Lating and Greek and Hebrew and Egyptian Hieroglyphs and shit but nothing too 
official or whatever."_ and claimed to have learned this information in, and I 
quote, _"The basement of this business where I live." [sic?]_

[Footnote 2: Though she may have simply been an unwashed caucasian, or perhaps an african american of very elegant ivory complexion.]

[Footnote 3: Which she mysteriously referred to as her favorite "kimono." When I inquired as to why and in what sense a stained mickey mouse sweatshirt and sweatpants was a kimono, she said, and I quote, "I mean it's a thing I'm kiing [sic?] whatever just undo-babeling [sic?] here like y'know "culture" and stuff or whatever I dunno words are dumb, ha." When I then asked her if she meant "I'm king," or "undue babbling," she simply said "what?" and returned to helping us with the translation. When I further inquired as to what culture she identified with, she simply said "ha, ew" before giggling and moving closer to me. I'm not quite sure what to make of this girl. Somehow she makes me feel strangely comfortable though. Introspection ongoing.]

The individual in question offered to help us with the translation of the Qi 
story, on conditions of "can i write however i want as long as it's right? 
(smiling excitedly)," which, when we probed her for further details, appeared 
to have been a request for uncensored freedom of expression. She also asked for 
a bite of my sandwich. Although she helped us for several minutes while a 
decision was being made, our editorial team was disheartened to have to decline 
her offer of help, and soon thereafter she said she had somewhere to be, before 
promptly telling us she loves us, giving me a hug, and leaving. She didn't say 
where she was going. I wish I knew. I often find myself thinking about her,
ever since she left. Whoever she was, I miss her.

That aside, the nature of Mister Qi's collective reckoning plan remains
unknown. Investigation ongoing. We're just going to have to do the best we can
on our own...

Editorial Preface, written following a very serious meeting between yours truly and my truly, um, boss:

After a recent article in a newspaper which this current newspaper most certainly is, in which much to the surprise of the journalists herein -- not to mention we here on the public relations team (are we seriously going to write the piece like this? really? ok jesus, w/e) we were informed that we should apparently be very ashamed, and were rather roundly chastised by our p\*(arents + eers) for allowing a racist sexist terrorist group to make us look like a bunch of, as they put it, "goddamn amateurs," even though to be fair we're (and were) working very hard here (or: "HH") already and given everything we have on our plates we can't be expected to read and understand every single one of our sources especially all of those fucking footnotes cuz damn, and then write a knowledgeable and intelligent and well re(searched + ceived) article properly formatted with the mandated margins and style, all the while placing due emphasis (of course) on the proper deployment of this week's most updated set of Sympathetic Terminology For Bringing Yet Again to Light the Plight of the Very Most Officially Disadvantaged, yet snevertheles (what?) our journalists and translators and writers and staff have agreed that it would seem unseemly to allow ourselves to be out-cultured on culture by a cult that has none -- and who in a statement over the telephone to me this very morning claimed that it doesn't give, and I quote "N fucks for any N > 0" about any of the cultures on the planet that I could find in the Big Book of Every Culture on the Planet -- so anyways in light of all that, we here at the newspaper thing mentioned supra (i.e., here) have chosen to study and adopt some of the
r*(acist + apist)
sex*(ist + less)
cultural*(appropriative + imperialist)
terrorist faction L.D.™'s tactics and style and demonstrate that
i*(t + s + n) fact possible
to collectively be socio-culturally sensitive to every possible preference of every possible person at once without also being "completely fucking dumb," as one Chinese American reader called our article last week in a comment on the internet that made me cry and then drink.

Thenceforth, our staff has adopted some of
X*(hose + error + actics), where X = t,
and appropriated them for the forces of G[o]d™
where o = oo,
(why are we doing this exactly?)
by collecting a collection of the
terror*(ists' + s/t)
in grammar and style and their intentional violations of the
Di[c]t[a]tes of Proper English Etiquette,
where c = ck and a = as
(a.k.a., the Dicktastes of PEE (who writes like this!?)),
strategically collected from the writings of L.D.™,
and burn-ish'ed them with fire and fiery speech while at the same time pledging to even more wholly adhere to the fledgling set of (N)ew (H)oly (S)tandards (does anyone know what this one is all about?) lain out in the cooperatively published collective standard industry publication:

> _No Translation Without Cultural Appropriation, Vol. I.IV.All:_
> _A Culturally Cautious Journalist's Guide To The Most[1]_
> _Proper Principles & Practices[2] of Socially Sensitive[3]_
> _Modern Multi-Language Transl(1 + iter)ation._

ARTICLE NAME: "Is Quite Ironed!"

After having recently completed a prison term for a previous convinction of 
violent insensitivity, Mister Qí of the Los Angeles district formerly known as 
Qínatown was indicted again within seve[N] hours of his release, for some 
value of N in the set {ral,n}.

The serial ra[p]ist Qí, for some value of p in the set {c}, was apprehended 
this evening around 七:53, after a local [X]man (for X = wo) of 
Korean-American descent and Laundro-American employment complained that Mister 
Qí had approached her out of nowhere at her place of 
employment/business/work and complimented her for her expertise in ironing 
and laundry services.「What, are you saying we all work at laundromats or 
something?」って the victim was heard to say. Police promptly arrived and 
removed Mister Qí from the premises, keeping as evidence the pile of clothing 
he had been carrying with him for a still unknown reason, which rapidly 
unfolded with the commotion of the evening's events after police arrived on the 
scene. More details to be provided as the story and clothing (un + 1)fold, 
respectively.

In the intervening time, Mister Qí has been fired from his job at something 
called the N ASA JP L (ん 朝 日 을) a company whose name loosely translates 
as "N. Morning Sun. L."[1]

Mister Qí will serve another term in sensitivity prison, and be required to 
pay a fine of Qī qiān dollars, a quantity of money presumably derived from 
his name.

I mean come on, that's clearly something asian right?]

[DISGUSTING-ABUSIVE-MANIPULATIVE-RAPIST-FUCKING-PIG'S-NAME-REDACTED] was born into a broken home near [CITY-REDACTED] California, spent much of his childhood dealing with his father's suicide attempts and addiction to heroin, and spent periods in homeless shelters. [FUCKING-PIG] eventually developed symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder, often taking as many as 8 showers a day and finding himself unable to eat in his own kitchen. As a teenager, [REDACTED-SEXIST-SEX-ABUSER] discovered his bisexuality and found relief in sex, discovering his love for computers and programming around the same time. As he later told [PUBLICATION-REDACTED], these newfound love affairs with humans and ideas made him feel "like the world was not a lost place" after all. 
At [COLLEGE-REDACTED] he gained recognition for demonstrating his ability to remotely break in to a number of his professors' computers, which he stated "earned him a few A grades." Subsequently, [EVIL-FUCKING-SERIAL-RAPIST-PSYCHOPATH-REDACTED] began to build his reputation through work as an information security specialist, working for non-profit organizations such as Greenpeace, Rainforest Action Network, and [KINKY-WORD-REDACTED].com, a famous BDSM porn site, because apparently he enjoys that sort of thing or whatever and for some reason is willing to talk about it openly.

[BOSSY-DOMINEERING-SADISTIC-MISOGYNIST] was fired from his position at [NON-PROFIT-HELPING-PEOPLE-WHO-LIVE-UNDER-VARIOUS-TOTALITARIAN-REGIMES-TO-FREELY-ACCESS-OUTSIDE-INFORMATION-UNREDACTED-REDACTED] this week after allegations that he had done some weird half-conscious sex stuff with some people he used
to date and/or be friends with while they were both on drugs and/or drunk and/or asleep sharing a bed because he said "hey you can sleep here if you want" -- something the author of this article has most certainly never done by accident or on purpose, not even a lot.

[PIG-FUCKER-REDACTED] will appear in court Never, at Never:00 AM (PST) this coming Never, having already been sufficiently tried and found guilty by social media, the news media, a website someone made with some really seriously pretty CSS by the way, some stories that we've all been hearing for awhile (for some value of "we" equal to someone else over there somewhere whatever who fucking cares), and found guilty most importantly of all by our hearts, by the feelings we felt in our deepest down parts where we keep all our innocence and good intentions and virtue, and how horrible the aforementioned parts of our hearts felt when we read all that stuff with the mean nasty words about what the bad man did that made us feel the bad feelings.

Against that background, while many details of the surrounding events remain vague and [not-entirely-without-a-sizable-degree-of-internal-contradictions-and/or-inconsistenc(y/ies)], one thing that all sensitive compassionate persons everywhere can agree upon is that this disgusting abusive manipulative narcissistic psychopathic cold-blooded sex-offender should not be in anything resembling a position of [X] for any value of X other than publicly humiliated. Amen.
